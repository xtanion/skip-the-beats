Introduction
============
Thanks for downloading this software. You can find out more information about the algorithms by checking the following papers:
1) D. Saxena, J. Duro, A. Tiwari, K. Deb, Q. Zhang, "Objective reduction in many-objective optimization: Linear and nonlinear algorithms", in IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, vol. 17, no. 1, pp. 77-99, 2013.
2) J. A. Duro, D. K. Saxena, K. Deb, and Q. Zhang, "Machine Learning based Decision Support for Many-objective Optimization Problems", in Neurocomputing, vol. 146, no. 0, pp. 30-47, 2014.

This software includes two objective reduction algorithms, namely L-PCA and NL-MVU-PCA, and their corresponding folders are 
   l_pca_dmoss_kemoss/
   nl_mvu_pca_dmoss_kemoss/

The file dtlz5_2_5_moea.out contains the population generated by a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm when applied to DTLZ5(I,M), where I=2 and M=5. The file contains five columns of data that correspond to the five objectives of the problem.

The files data_lpca.log and data_nlmvupca.log contains a report generated by the above algorithms when applied to the population in the dtlz5_2_5_moea.out file.

Instructions
===========

For both algorithms there is a Debug and Release folder with Makefiles. The Makefile in the Debug folder compiles the software with debug flags on, and no debug flags are used when the Makefile of the Release folder is used. 

Compilation for both algorithms
   make

To clean the compilation
   make clean

To execute
   ./l_pca_dmoss_kemoss/Release/l_pca_dmoss_kemoss dtlz5_2_5_moea.out
or
   ./nl_mvu_pca_dmoss_kemoss/Release/nl_mvu_pca_dmoss_kemoss dtlz5_2_5_moea.out
